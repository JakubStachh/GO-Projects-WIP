# 📌 Factorial Calculation in Go (Recursive Approach)

## 🚀 Description
This Go program calculates the factorial of a given number using a recursive function. The factorial of a number `n` (denoted as `n!`) is the product of all positive integers from `1` to `n`. It is defined as:
##
$$
\large n!=n×(n−1)×(n−2)×...×1
$$
##
For example:

- `5! = 5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1 = 120`

- `3! = 3 × 2 × 1 = 6`

- `0! = 1` (by definition)

## 🔍 How It Works
#### This program implements a recursive function `factorial(n int) int`:

1. If `n` is `0`, the function returns `1` (base case).

1. Otherwise, the function returns `n * factorial(n-1)`, where the function calls itself with `n-1` until it reaches `0`.

### Program Flow:
1. **Base Case**: When `n == 0`, return `1`.

2. **Recursive Case**: When `n > 0`, return `n * factorial(n-1)`.

3. **Execution**: The function keeps calling itself with `n-1` until it reaches `0`, at which point it starts returning values back up the call stack.

## 🎯 Example Output
```sh
Factorial of 5: 120
```
For input `n = 5`, the program calculates:

##
$$
\large 5!=5×4×3×2×1=120
$$

📝 Code Explanation
factorial(n int) int:

If n == 0, return 1.

Otherwise, return n * factorial(n-1).

Uses recursion to break down the problem into smaller subproblems.

main():

Calls factorial(5) to calculate the factorial of 5 and prints the result.
